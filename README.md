- 👋 Hi, I’m Jennie! I'm a developer with 3 years of work experience, looking to dive back into a software career. Well, a slow dive. Ideally, I'll continue doing freelance/contract work, or part-time remote work, until fall 2024.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in automating systems and processes to make people's lives easier. My most recent project was a scoring sheet for a math test with challenging scoring rules. It has already saved local teachers hundreds of hours of tedious, difficult work.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack, react. Really enjoying python.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting!
